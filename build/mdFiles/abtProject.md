# 🌐 Distributed Cloud Network

A decentralized, resilient, and community-powered cloud infrastructure built by leveraging underutilized compute from contributors around the world.

---

## 🚀 What Is This Project?

This is a distributed cloud platform where anyone can contribute unused compute power — like laptops, desktops, or idle servers — to power the internet.

Instead of relying on centralized cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure), this project aims to create a more **open, fault-tolerant, and democratic cloud infrastructure**.

Whether you want to host websites, run apps, or deploy containers, our orchestrator ensures **high availability** even when individual nodes go offline.

## 💡 Why Is This Important?

1. **💸 Reduce Cloud Costs**  
   Hosting on big cloud platforms is expensive. With our community cloud, workloads are distributed across volunteers and contributors — cutting costs drastically.

2. **🌍 Leverage Underused Resources**  
   Millions of CPUs and GPUs sit idle. We unlock the power of that hardware for real work.

3. **🛡️ Increased Resilience**  
   Traditional clouds are single points of failure. Our system replicates workloads across unreliable nodes for better fault tolerance.

4. **🔓 Open Infrastructure**  
   The infrastructure shouldn't be controlled by a few corporations. Our mission is to **decentralize** the cloud.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- 🖥️ **Provider Nodes**  
  Contributors install a lightweight agent that securely connects their machine to the network.

- ⚙️ **Orchestrator**  
  Our central controller dynamically allocates workloads across healthy nodes. It handles failover, monitoring, and scaling.

- 📦 **Application Layer**  
  Users can deploy websites, web apps, or services on the distributed cloud using a simple interface or CLI.

- 🧠 **Intelligent Scheduling**  
  Nodes can disconnect or go offline anytime — the orchestrator reroutes and re-replicates workloads dynamically.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

Whether you're a developer, a systems engineer, or just someone with an idle machine, there's a place for you in this project.

### 💻 1. Become a Node Provider

You can donate spare CPU, memory, or storage:

```bash
# Coming Soon: install the CLI agent
curl -sSL https://yourcloud.network/install.sh | bash
