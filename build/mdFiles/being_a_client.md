# 🌐 Using the Distributed Cloud as a Client

Want to deploy a website, app, or container on a resilient, decentralized cloud? This guide walks you through becoming a **client** of the distributed cloud.

## 👤 Who Is a Client?

A **client** is anyone who uses the network to **host applications, websites, or workloads**. Whether you're a developer deploying a side project or a company testing a scalable backend — the distributed cloud is built for you.

## 🚀 Why Use This Cloud?

- **Highly available** — apps stay online even when nodes fail
- **Cost-effective** — run workloads on underutilized machines
- **Fast deployment** — from CLI or dashboard
- **Privacy-first** — you control your data
- **Open-source** — no vendor lock-in
